/**
 * "Heaven" (internal name: Homegoing, formerly "A Peaceful Goodbye") — shared core.
 *
 * This module holds every piece of the homegoing-video feature that is
 * testable without a server runtime: input validation, sanitization, and
 * assembly of the Grok Imagine video prompt. `worker.ts` is a thin HTTP
 * shell over these functions, and the wizard page reuses the same
 * validation so client and server can never disagree.
 *
 * Product invariants (enforced here, tested in homegoing.test.ts):
 *   - Consent is mandatory — the payload is rejected without it.
 *   - The story is fixed: embrace → reassurance → goodbye → walking with
 *     Jesus into the sky. User text can only colour the setting, never
 *     rewrite the plot.
 *   - Every prompt carries the guardrails: no speaking, no graves/
 *     coffins/illness, adult subjects, faithful faces, modest clothing,
 *     and one "SAVEDD.COM" watermark, spelled with two Ds.
 *   - User text is length-capped and control-character-stripped so the
 *     wizard cannot be used to smuggle arbitrary instructions past the
 *     template.
